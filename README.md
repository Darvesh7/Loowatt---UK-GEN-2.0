# Loowatt---UK-GEN-2.0

-----Changes in Version 3 of FrontEnd PCB-----

1. Added Button Cap in 3D CAD. 
2. Rotated the RJ45 Connector.
3. Shifted the Micro-controller towards center of board.
4. Added extra hole to hold cables


-----Changes not perform-----

No button placement changes (CAD is different from actual product) & actual prototype PCB - buttons placement is OK.
